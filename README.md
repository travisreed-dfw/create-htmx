# create-htmx-app

Set up a modern HTMX web app by running one command.

    create-htmx-app my-htmx-app
    cd my-htmx-app
    npx start

This will create a new HTMX app with the latest version of HTMX downloaded and saved locally, ready for you to start developing. The npx serve public command will serve your static files from the public directory.
