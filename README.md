# create-htmx

Set up a modern HTMX web app by running one command.

    npx create-htmx my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.

This will create a new HTMX app with the latest version of HTMX downloaded and saved locally, ready for you to start developing. The npx serve public command will serve your static files from the public directory.
